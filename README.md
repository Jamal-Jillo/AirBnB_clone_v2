# AirBnB_clone

AirBnB clone - The console
This is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because I will use what I build during this project with all my other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…
Command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

### Description

        Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
        Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
        Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
        Update attributes of an object
        Destroy an object

*importing packages/modules have been a pain in the ass, ngl!!*
